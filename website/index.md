# Longeve Website

This is a live experiment on making a website that lasts 100 years.

This website is both the experiment and the documentation about the Longeve project and this experiment.

## Website

A **website** is a collection of HTML web pages and assets (images, CSS stylesheets, webfonts, JavaScript scripts).

A website is not a book.

## Static website

A **static** website is a website whose resources are already generated, tipically as files.

Some generated resources can produce "dynamic" content (effects, animations, generated content or interrogate external API).

## Generated website

A website can be **generated** from a source.

This allows a better separation between different contents. The text of a website can be separated from the layout, and common parts of the layout can be included.

## Repository

The source code of the website should have a **repository**.
